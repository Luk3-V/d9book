## Pay videos

* [drupalize.me](https://drupalize.me/) is an amazing training facility spun off from [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/) which provides on-demand training and articles on all things Drupal.  This is definitely worth a subscription if you want to fully grasp Drupal development or bring new people up to speed.
* [Symfonycasts](https://symfonycasts.com/) is another incredibly good service that teaches all about the nuts and bolts of Symfony, PHPUnit and many other tools.  I think the Drupal course they have might be a little dated now.
