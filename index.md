## Welcome to Drupal 9 at your fingertips
## A Drupal developers reference
## by Selwyn Polit

I've collected a bunch of code while developing Drupal sites.  I could have used a pretty comprehensive set of code samples to make more sense of how to do things the Drupal way.

Chapters (in no particular order)

[Batch and Queue](book/bq.html)

[Blocks](book/blocks.html)

[Nodes and Fields](book/nodes_n_fields.html)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/selwynpolit/d9book/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
