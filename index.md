## Welcome to Drupal 9 at your fingertips
### A Drupal developers reference
#### by Selwyn Polit

I've collected a bunch of code while developing Drupal sites.  While developing and hunting through examples on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) I sure could have used a comprehensive set of code samples to make more sense of how to do things the [Drupal way](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/drupal-way-philosophy).  I would suggest that you avail yourself of the excellent [examples module](https://www.drupal.org/project/examples) which goes much deeper than I do on so many topics.
