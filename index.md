## Welcome to Drupal 9 at your fingertips
### A Drupal developers reference
#### by Selwyn Polit
#### and hopefully others

I've collected a bunch of code while developing Drupal sites.  While developing and hunting through examples on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) I sure could have used a comprehensive set of code samples to make more sense of how to do things the [Drupal way](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/drupal-way-philosophy).  Be sure to avail yourself of the excellent [examples module](https://www.drupal.org/project/examples) which goes much deeper than I do on so many topics.  This is intended to be a quick-ish reference for developers working on sites. Please forgive the todo items - I've found that if I want to get everything perfect, I'll never publish anything. Perhaps use this as your opportunity to add something.
